# Journal

## Explanation of the app
For this project, I've created an app that represents a journal. In this app, you can add new journal entries and see journal entries that you added before. A journal entry consists of the date/timestamp of the entry, the entry contents and an emoji reprenting your mood at the time of the entry.

## Implemented extra's
- When the user creates a journal entry and he/she chooses a mood, feedback is given on which mood the user chose. 

This extra is shown in the section "Screenshots of the app".
