# Journal

## Explanation of the app
For this project, you will create an app that represents a journal. In this app, you should be able to view a list of your journal entries, and of course also add new ones. A journal entry should typically consist of at least a few fields, such as the date/timestamp of the entry, the entry contents and some addition, such as an emoji reprenting your mood at the time of the entry.
