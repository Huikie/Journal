# Journal

## Explanation of the app
For this project, I've created an app that represents a journal. In this app, you can add new journal entries and see journal entries that you added before. A journal entry consists of the date/timestamp of the entry, the entry contents and an emoji reprenting your mood at the time of the entry.
